# Blackboard-VLE-Redesign-Prototyping-Wireframing
This repository showcases the redesign of the Blackboard Virtual Learning Environment (VLE), focusing on improving its usability and functionality based on user feedback gathered through user surveys and think-aloud protocol.

This project focuses on redesigning and improving the Blackboard Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) based on user surveys and the think-aloud protocol. My goal was to create a more functional and intuitive version of the VLE, addressing user pain points and enhancing the overall learning experience.

I utilised Figma to prototype and wireframe the redesign, ensuring that the new layout was both user-centric and aligned with the feedback gathered from users. The design improvements were informed by real-world user insights, including navigation ease, accessibility, and usability.

You can explore the interactive prototype and detailed wireframes through the following link: [Blackboard VLE Prototype](https://www.figma.com/design/TEYQ1dSJCEqmGhKDi8riCh/Blackboard-VLE?node-id=0-1&t=BT3EsPko96QEhCOs-1).

This project demonstrates my ability to create functional and user-focused designs by applying design thinking methodologies such as user research, prototyping, and iterative feedback.
